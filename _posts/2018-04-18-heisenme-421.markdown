Outside Russia, **Pasternak** is best known as the author of **Doctor Zhivago** (1957), a novel which takes place between the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the Second World War. Doctor Zhivago was rejected for publication in the USSR. At the instigation of Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, Doctor Zhivago was smuggled to Milan and published in 1957 and distributed with the help of the **CIA** in the rest of Europe.[3] Pasternak was awarded the **Nobel Prize** for Literature in 1958, an event which enraged the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which forced him to decline the prize, though his descendants were later to **accept it in his name** in 1988.
